# Purpose

_Giving people the right information when they need it, in the right form._

We want to solve the problem of information context. With more data available than ever, the problem becomes getting the right data at the right time.

Examples of how we embody this purpose:
  * _Better Customer Journey Systems_ - Improve customer experiences using web technology. With faster feedback loops via prototyping, Scrum and tools which improve transparency.
  * _Easier 3rd Party Web Components_: Website Owners should be able to install and manage their website from a single place, instead of having to find and manage many 3rd party component management dashboards.

The purpose statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to this mission to justify our projects and other pages of this manual.
