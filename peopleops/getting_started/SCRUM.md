# Scrum

Countable uses [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage work delivery and collaboratively learn about problem domains. Check out the guide book from the inventor of Scrum [here](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

## Purpose

Learn how to achieve [Key Results](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/OKRS.md) rapidly together.

## Scope

Define how Countable "follows" Scrum.

## Principles

1. Ship work to real users and get feedback _every sprint_. Don't allow "work in progress" to not be released. Instead, plan your work so it's releasable every 2 weeks or _ideally, every day_.
2. Make sure everyone's clear on the _Objective of the work_.
3. _Communicate_ with your project team about how you're  least once a day about how you're reaching the objective.

## Process

### Project Objective and Key Results

Every team should have one or more [Objective](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/OKRS.md). This is a written goal discussed with the team to ensure clarity, and is used by the [Product Owner](#product-owner) to order the [Backlog](#backlog).

### Sprint

A sprint is a period (1 week to 1 month) punctuated by a Sprint meeting.

The [Scrum Master](#scrum-master) must review tickets for clarity (triage them) from Requests to Backlog.
The [Product Owner](#product-owner) must review tickets for priority (order the Backlog).

#### Sprint Meeting Goals

1. Measure what % done our Key Results are. Estimate completion of each KR. Quickly check any metrics necessary.
1. Each team member takes 2 minutes to what they shipped each week. Don't show work in progress. Screen share or show a visual is possible, only demonstrate what you've made ready to "ship". Then they take 1 minutes to indicate what's blocking their work, and we determine who will help them on it after the meeting.
1. Review any cards left in the sprint column. Why are they there? How can we avoid that?
1. The team moves cards they want to work on during the current sprint into the "sprint" column. They may always take more cards from the backlog later on they finish early.
1. Move the Trello Cards that best achieve the project's key results and no more than we can actually do, to the sprint column. _when does this happen?_

We release (ship) our work to real customers at the end of the sprint.

#### Stand-up Meetings
Countable doesn't hold synchronous stand-up meetings. Instead, every day, please share something on your team's public slack channel regarding the work you did. It's best to show a screenshot of your work for feedback.

## Reference

### Roles
These are the duties we must assigned when doing Scrum.

#### Product Owner
  * Develops User Stories by talking to real users and ensures those users' needs are being met by the team.
  * Clarifies how to achieve our [Key Results](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/OKRS.md), while taking input from team.
  * Triage the Trello Requests column into an Ordered Backlog of work.
  * Makes sure items in the backlog are clear to developers. The product owner is typically our client.

#### Scrum Master
  * Chair the sprint meeting, asking good questions in order to understand our progress towards the project goal.
  * Trains the team on Scrum and makes sure we're following the rules of scrum effectively (shipping each week, continuously learning, making tickets clear)
  * Find problems in workflow and make them visible for the team to work together on during the Sprint Plan meeting.

#### Developers (and other technicians)
  * Ensures they have a challenging yet doable amount of work in their sprint each sprint.
  * Takes care to understand items in their sprint.
  * Takes responsibility for shipping the work each sprint.

### Backlog

The Backlog is a list of all the actions we current believe will accomplish the goal of our project. This should be ordered by impact to effort ratio. That is, items which make the biggest difference in the least time should be done first.
 
We do not have daily stand-up meetings since our team works in different timezones. Instead, we have a slack channel where people should communicate about what they're working on, coordinate code reviews, and figure out logistics to ship their work every week, and generate ideas for the sprint plan meeting.

For a visual aid of how our work is processed, see this [Business Process Diagram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VrniT1lRqVu9sJr0ZMK1aQLnFwEuFIQD).

Note: Instead of just talking about what did you do this week, try to use a screen share feature to walk along all of your "done" trello tickets, explaining one by one. This helps the team to better understand all of your work.
