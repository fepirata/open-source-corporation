# Filtering Leads

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those who believe in the same things as us. The following
set of inquiries outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1) Can we articuate one of the following together? A problem, opportunity, or vision.

2) Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a big impact?

3) Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let's prototype a relationship - we'll complete a 3 week project together with no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to pursue further work.
