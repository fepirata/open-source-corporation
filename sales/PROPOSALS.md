# How To Write Good Proposals

## Purpose

Improve the ROI of time spent writing proposals.

## Scope

Actionable tactics for achieving the above purpose. The author is most experienced writing proposals for the public sector.

## Principles

  * The process starts way before you start writing. You want to make sure the odds are stacked in your favour before you invest in writing anything.
  * Choose an RFP in an area where you have the most expertise, similar work (including successes to hilight), and have a network of people in that area.
  * Specialize! Choose similar projects, so you can re-use bits of old proposals that worked. It's better to solve the same problem really well than to spread yourself thin.
  * Ask questions to qualify or disqualify the project.
  * Find out who the front runner is. Is there an established company other than you that's won similar projects in this area?
  * If there's actual scoring criteria, you can forget much of the above, and just focus nearly 100% on that. But keep in mind those criteria will often overlap with other principles here.

## Process

### RFP Lead Capture

See [Filter](./FILTER.md)

### Pre-qualify

1. Determine who is the "frontrunner" who is most likely to bid and win the project. Is there a strong off-the-shelf solution which is compatible. If so, is there a local supplier? 
1. Review all evaluation criteria. What is the estimated score we could get on the project? Is it within 5% of frontrunner's estimated score?
1. Find frontrunner. What is the industry "state of the art" in this area. What is being used by others? Call local peers of prospect, and ask "we are researching options for X software, what do you use?".
1. Are we required to demo a mature product. Or MVP?
1. Estimate bid size, based on beating the frontrunner's score by 5%. If there's no budget for the project, estimate one based on past similar projects by the frontrunner, prospect, and software category.

### Qualify

You'll want to ask as many questions an possible before writing in order be confident about the project. Ideally, get on the phone with someone in order to make a "conceptual agreement". This won't always be possible.

1. Make a super clear, one sentence statement of the real problem the RFP wants to solve, in language you understand. Ask the prospect if this is the most important thing, and if not, what is?
1. Make a super clear, one sentence statement of your unique approach. Ask the prospect if it's a good approach.
1. Think of any possible reason your proposal might not be accepted. This is hard, but important. As a question for each uncertainty to determine if it's likely, or not.
1. Ask questions to clarify any scoring criteria so you're 100% clear what they each mean.
1. Ask questions to help you understand what the evaluators are looking for.

### Research

This is pretty dependent on the proposal, but the main goals are:

1. Further clarify your chances of winning.
1. Get the information you need to improve your chances of winning.

### Deciding to Write

With all the above done, you should now determine whether to write, or move on to a new RFP. You should know your approximate chances of winning, the value of the contract, and your alternatives, and make the best choice.

Are you the frontrunner? If not, can you propose a solution that is better in some way that matters to the prospect? The answer to one of these questions should be YES if you want to write.

### Angle

Now that you know the most important thing they want to achieve from your questions, you must create an "angle". This means you should create some uncertainty that competitors will deliver what matters, by emphasizing what's unique about your team's ability to solve the problem.

In particular, if you're not the frontrunner, this is critical. Plant a seed of doubt about the frontrunner and build on that. A good one is that as a newcomer you can provide more customization because your product is still more flexible and early in its development lifecycle.

If you are the a frontrunner, point to your past successes. Your angle is to create concern that other solutions don't have as much evidence of ability to deliver. 

### Addressing Criteria

If the RFP has scoring criteria already, this should be your focus. I suggest that you don't try to be clever and make up a proposal structure based on your domain knowledge.

Instead, the sections of your proposal should directly address the scoring criteria. Make it obvious, and re-use the exact words from the criteria in your answers. This makes it easy for the evaluator to mark you (and to give you a great score since they won't miss your answers). When in doubt, be clear, and be obvious about why you should get full marks on the criterion.

There are usually 2 types of criteria. First, a list of things that could disqualify you. Second, a list of categories where you can score points.

For the first category, make a checklist and make sure you're 100% confident in those items being checked off before you submit.For the actual scoring, it's likely the prospect has a committee reviewing scores, and likely they'll even be "blind". This means they'll be worried about being perceived as unfair, and will usually follow the criteria quite literally.

For scoring criteria that are clear, focus on creating the most truthful answer that will get the highest score. Get a "proxy" person to score you, and iterate to improve your score.

For scoring criteria that are less clear, there's going to be more subjectivity. Find out what probably matters most to your evaluators, going back to the questions you asked earlier.

### RFPs Without Criteria

When there's no criteria given, that may be a red flag. I'd recommend avoiding this kind of proposal unless you're confident they know what they want, and that you can give it to them better than anyone else, and you can explain how you'll do that in a compelling way. This kind of RFP will still often go to someone they know instead of the best applicant, so it's risky.

### Bidding Against ERPs

Often, we are proposing a Django based project as a more flexible, cheaper, faster and more maintainable alternative to an ERP implementation (Enterprise Resource Planning). Here are some problems with ERPs that we solve for our clients:

  * It takes an average of 11 months after go-live for SMBs to realize benefits from an ERP [1], whereas our implementations typically realize benefits in 6 to 8 weeks due to our rapid prototyping approach in the first 2 weeks.
  * In an ERP usage survey, only 14 of 287 respondents reported realizing the benefits of "Upgrading Technology" with an ERP, and 34 of 150 respondents realized the "Growth"-related goals they had when implementing ERP. ERP were more effective at realizing "Operational Efficiency" goals, however with 103 of 122 respondents reporting success.
  * Regarding ERPs "Of those organizations that have completed implementation, less than half (45%) experienced budget overruns. However, those that did experience overruns were an average of 24% over budget. When
youâ€™re talking about an implementation budget, 24% is a lot of money. On average, organizations
reported an expected budget of $1,007,767 and an actual budget of $1,247,859." [1]
